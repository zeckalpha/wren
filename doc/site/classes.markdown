^title Classes

Every value in Wren is an object, and every object is an instance of a class.
Even `true` and `false` are full-featured objects &mdash; instances of the `Bool` class.

Classes contain both *behavior* and *state*. Behavior is defined in *methods* which are stored in the class. State is defined in *fields*, whose values are stored in each instance.

## Defining a class

Classes are created using the `class` keyword, unsurprisingly:

    :::dart
    class Unicorn {}

This creates a class named `Unicorn` with no methods or fields.

## Methods

Once we've made a unicorn, to let it do stuff, we need to give it methods.

    :::dart
    class Unicorn {
      prance {
        IO.print("The unicorn prances in a fancy manner!")
      }
    }

This defines a `prance` method that takes no arguments. To support parameters, add a parenthesized parameter list after the method's name:

    :::dart
    class Unicorn {
      prance(where, when) {
        IO.print("The unicorn prances in " + where + " at " + when)
      }
    }

Unlike most other dynamically-typed languages, in Wren you can have multiple methods in a class with the same name, as long as they take a different number of parameters. In technical terms, you can overload by *arity*. So this class is fine:

    :::dart
    class Unicorn {
      prance {
        IO.print("The unicorn prances in a fancy manner!")
      }

      prance(where) {
        IO.print("The unicorn prances in " + where)
      }

      prance(where, when) {
        IO.print("The unicorn prances in " + where + " at " + when)
      }
    }

When you [call](method-calls.html) the `prance` method, it selects the right one based on how many arguments you pass it.

**TODO: Defining operators and setters.**

## Constructors

To create a new instance of a class, you use the `new` keyword. We can make a unicorn like so:

    :::dart
    new Unicorn

You almost always want to define some state or do some other initialization on a new object. For that, you'll want to define a constructor, like so:

    class Unicorn {
      new {
        IO.print("I am a constructor!")
      }
    }

When you create an instance with `new`, its constructor will be invoked. Like methods, you can pass arguments to the constructor by adding a parenthesized parameter list after `new`:

    class Unicorn {
      new(name, color) {
        IO.print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + color + ".")
      }
    }

Values are passed to the constructor like so:

    new Unicorn("Flicker", "purple")

## Fields

**TODO**

## Metaclasses and static members

**TODO**

## Inheritance

A class can inherit from a "parent" or *superclass*. When you invoke a method on an object of some class, if it can't be found, it walks up the chain of superclasses looking for it there.

By default, any new class inherits from `Object`, which is the superclass from which all other classes ultimately descend. You can specify a different parent class using `is` when you declare the class:

    :::dart
    class Pegasus is Unicorn {}

This declares a new class `Pegasus` that inherits from `Unicorn`.

The metaclass hierarchy does *not* parallel the regular class hierarchy. So, if `Pegasus` inherits from `Unicorn`, `Pegasus`'s metaclass will not inherit from `Unicorn`'s metaclass. In more prosaic terms, this means that static methods are not inherited.

Constructors, however, initialize the instance *after* it has been created. They are defined as instance methods on the class and not on the metaclass. That means that constructors *are* inherited.

## Superclass method calls

**TODO**
